# Paradox
## Content
<p align="justify">This document details what you will experience with Paradox. It will cover everything you need to know before getting started with Paradox; from the interface, to the features.</p>

## Introduction
<p align="justify">Paradox is a first of its kind software. It is the next generation programming tool for everyone. Paradox is easily accessible and easy to use. It works in a diagram-like, data flow inspired structure to represent data processing-centric functionality. It uses nodes which runs codes and Paradox provides a simple framework to create them and an editor to use them. Anyone with basic Python programming language understanding can use Paradox with ease. </p>

## Background

<p align="justify">In computing, a process is the instance of a computer program that is being executed by one or many threads. It contains the program code and its activity. Depending on the operating system (OS), a process may be made up of multiple threads of execution that execute instructions concurrently. In Paradox the imput-process-output concept is utilized on top of dataflow programming.</p>

<p align="justify">Dataflow programming (DFP) introduces a new programming paradigm that internally represents applications as a directed graph, similarly to a dataflow diagram. Applications are represented as a set of nodes (also called blocks) with input and/or output ports in them. In comaprision to the standard executive flow programming used in most editors where an action needs to be triggred to obtain result Paradox which uses dataflow method requires no action to be triggered and the output is obtained directly.</p>

<p align="justify">
The key benefit of Dataflow programming is that, in dataflow, more than one instruction can be executed at once. Thus, if several instructions be- come fire able at the same time, they can be executed in parallel. This simple principle provides the potential for massive parallel execution at the instruction level.</p>

<p align="justify">
DFP has enabled many visual programming languages that provide a more user-friendly interface so that even non-technical users can write programs. Such languages are also suited for rapid prototyping.</p>


<p align="justify">Paradox utilizes dataflow programming in Json formating so it is easy to use and mostly errorfree.</p>

### Create clear and pretty flows
<p align="justify">Visual Scripting is a huge part of Paradox. Paradox uses blocks and nodes that help in creating clear and pretty flow. It makes it easy to follow, easy to script for rookie programmer and experienced programmers alike.</p>

### Built-In Interpreter 
<p align="justify">Paradox uses the built-in REPL through which you can have access to the backend session and you can use its whole API as well as access your nodes. Any modifications like creating/renaming/deleting new scripts, will reactively be processed by the frontend automatically, so you can really do everything from the console.</p>

### Python3 by default
<p align="justify">Paradox has almost every python inbuilt functions integrated in it, which you can access instantly with right click of your mouse. </p>

### Source Code Access
<p align="justify">In Paradox you can access the Source code implementation of the nodes you use inside the editor. You can view and edit the source code as you and the result of the change change can be viewed in real time. </p>

### Stylus support
<p align="justify">Paradox supports stylus, you can write notes into your flows by hand using a stylus pen. One effective use of this feature is that it supports clarity and adds a whole new dimension to your visual flows.</p>

### Work fast with parallel computing
<p align="justify">Your work feels satisfying when your work get seem less and fast. Through simple GUI and tools to work with for developer, Programming would be more easier , simpler to code, understand and build an incredible product.</p>

### Integrate Social authorization
<p align="justify">Paradox allows user to login through social applications.</p>

### Buliding your own blog
<p align="justify">With the help of Paradox you can create your own blog</p>

### Multiple Themes
<p align="justify">There are many themes available in paradox, you can change them to which ever you like.</p>

### Multiple Modes
<p align="justify">Paradox consists of two modes that you can work with, data-flow and exec-flow. Data-flow is the default mode. Anyone who want to use Paradox in any mode they like is able to do so.</p>

### Multiple Extension
<p align="justify">Paradox has multiple extensions for you to use, like nodes, numpy, PyQt5, PySide2, Resources, ryvencore_qt. These extension helps you to enhance you're experience with Paradox.</p>

 ## Variable
 <p align="justify">At the right side of the Paradox UI there is a variable panel where you can initialize variables.</p>

 ## Log
 <p align="justify">Log is the section at the bottonm of Paradox, you can get to this interface by pullig the bottom tab upward; this consists of global and error sections. Global shows the variables in the script if assigned and errors as the name suggests shows the error but with paradox errors are very unlikely</p>

 ## Source Code
 <p align="justify">Paradox uses diagramatic scripting but you can also view the source for the script in each of the node and blocks, these source code are editable. You can make what ever changes you wish to make with-in the blocks. If the change is made in any particular block that change doesnot effect other blocks.</p>

 ## Macro 
 <p align="justify">A macro is a compile-time function that transforms a part of the program to allow functionality that cannot be expressed cleanly in normal library code. Paradox includes a macro option where you can create your custom functions/blocks.</p>
